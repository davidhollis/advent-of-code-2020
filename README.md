My 2020 advent of code solutions

Code is all in [`src/main/scala`](https://github.com/davidhollis/advent-of-code-2020/tree/main/src/main/scala)

You can run any particular day with

```bash
sbt "runMain day$N.Main"
```

where `$N` is the two-digit day number (for example, `day01.Main` is the entry point for day 1's solution)
